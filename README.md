### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm ABlyh-LEO, and you can just call me ABlyh(In most social accounts I will use the nickname "ABlyh").

Currently, I'm a freshman studying at the School of the Gifted Young of USTC. I haven't decided on my major yet(thanks to the policy of SGY, there is no need for me to decide which major to learn in grade 1), but I hope that I can be a student majoring in information and computing science(I have to highlight that this major in our school belongs to the school of math because there are so many people misunderstand it as computer science or computer engineering or something like that).

I used to be an OIer and now I'm an ICPCer. I don't have a good performance in OI(In 2021, I got 1st prize in NOIP of Shandong province and that's my best grade in OI), so I want to work hard to do well in ICPC. Last year(2023), I struggled to get the chance to go to a regional contest but only got an honorable mention in ICPC-Nanjing. This year, I will continue studying competitive programming.

My favorite language is Cpp. Due to the policy of CCF, I know little about modern Cpp but I'm currently studying the new features and I'm deeply moved by the beauty of them. I can write some Python code as well, but I'm quite unfamiliar with this fast-developing language. It's so powerful that I can always be fascinated by its magical style of solving problems.

I used to write some open-source code in junior high, but I almost lost this precious ability. You can just consider me a newcomer in Github and I can't wait to learn more about the details of the zen of open source.

You can always contact me by email: lyh@mail.ustc.edu.cn.
